## TroubleShooting

- You should at least have 5M available space.
- Modify Update-Config.sh and manually update clash config, service will auto restart.
- Too many open files:

```
root@K2P:/etc/sysctl.d# cat ./99-ulimit.conf
fs.file-max=65536
root@K2P:/etc/sysctl.d# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-ulimit.conf
fs.file-max = 65536
```

- **Due to the lack of feature SO_MARK, this method CANNOT proxy gateway itself unless you use cgroup.**
